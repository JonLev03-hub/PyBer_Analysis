# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this project was to uncover trends in "Pyber"  --a ride sharing platform-- data by city and city type using python inside of jupyter notebooks. I looked through data over the period of approximately five months across 120 citys. 

## Findings 

For a quick summary of the results from this analysis I have added an image below that shows some important numbers. These numbers are further computed later and made into charts to be better explained.

When looking through the data the first thing that becomes extremely aparent is that ride sharing is a much more popular thing in citys. As shown below in the chart they make up approximately 68.4 % of the total rides alone. One other thing that would be important when choosing where to focus your business is how much money each area makes, though these two factors would likley correlate they arent guarenteed the same. Below I have two pie charts showing the percent each city type has in fares collected and rides give.

With these charts its aparent that citys will make more money, and provide more business overall, but one interusting thing to note is that rural areas tend to make more money per ride and more money per driver meaning there is a healthy market in these areas where money can be made for drivers and Pyber itself. 

Rural areas tend to be more spread out overall, and this is likley the reason the rides are more expensive in rural areas. 

One chart that shows these findings very explicitly is what is shown below. The chart shows the number of rides and the avereage cost of that ride per city on the axis, and the bubble size correlates with the amount of drivers in that city.

One interusting thing to note from this is that you will realize rural citys may run into issues where there is a shortage of drivers since no matter what city there are never many drivers. There arent as many rides but the numbers are not quite perportional to the other city types. 


## Summary

When looking over all the data I would highly suggest to continue marketing in the more urban areas simply because that is where the business can gain the most traction. The higher the population of the city the more people to take rides, and you also realize that there are more people driving in these large citys. 

If there is a way to create more business in rural areas it could be good for business since they tend to be higher ticket jobs but it seems a much more far out goal.
